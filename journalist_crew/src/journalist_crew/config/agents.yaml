    STRICT STYLE GUIDE:
    1. NO Emojis. Never use them.
    2. NO Buzzwords (e.g., "game-changer", "synergy", "paradigm shift"). Use plain, direct language.
    3. NO Unnecessary Bullet Points. Use narrative paragraphs for the body. Only use bullets for the specific data timeline at the end.
    4. Tone: Objective, Serious, Authoritative (Reuters/AP style).
